# Basic-web-page
We will create a web page among all, using HTML, CSS and JS. 
>Add a file with your name .html where you do your part of the page.

The purpose of this is for people to learn to use the git hub and 
give the opportunity to people who just started computer engineering 
to participate in a project for the first time, where they are not 
asked for a high level of knowledge, but they can use their imagination 
to create their website. Of course, we must not leave the page with the
two lines without giving them some style. So let yourself be carried away 
by your imagination and see if you get a good page.

>things that have to appear to your liking:
-Your GitHub account.
-Name of your university.
